== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does the plugin do? =
* Adds decoding="async" & loading="lazy" attributes to all images on the page. It has been experimentally proven that the combination of these attributes speeds up page load by 0.1-0.2 seconds and increases Your Google PageSpeed Insights Score.
* Adds loading="lazy" attributes to all &lt;iframe&gt; on the page.
* You can include a script that removes the Google PageSpeed Insights remark "Does not use passive listeners to improve scrolling performance"

= In WordPress 5.5 and up, images are lazy loaded by default. Why is this plugin needed? =
By default, WordPress add a loading="lazy" attribute to the following images:
* images within post content
* images within post excerpts
* images within text widgets
* avatar images
* template images using wp_get_attachment_image()
But WordPress does not add loading="lazy" for custom images in the header and footer of the site! In this case, our plugin will help you.

= Where are the plugin settings? =
The settings are located at the section of the admin panel WP Booster > PageSpeed Helper

= How to set up? =
1. In the first tab ‚ÄòSettings‚Äô you can choose how to add attributes.

* The first method ‚ÄòFilters‚Äô is safe, but does not apply attributes to all images.
* The second method ‚ÄòBuffer‚Äô will add attributes to all images, but may cause problems on some sites.
* You can choose what values set to attributes or turn off them at all.

2. At the second tab ‚ÄòScripts‚Äô you can turn on a script,
which removes the Google PageSpeed Insights remark ‚ÄúDoes not use passive listeners to improve scrolling performance‚Äù.

= What is 'Does not use passive listeners to improve scrolling performance' ???? =
This PSI note, for example, may appear on pages where the comment-reply.min.js script is loaded. Several other scripts can also lead to this remark.

= I installed the plugin but my Google PageSpeed Insights score did not increase =
* Clear cache on your site
* The maximum effect will be on page with images. No images - no result
* Plugin does not affect images added to background via css, for the simple reason that it is impossible to add decoding="async" and loading="lazy" attributes to them. The plugin only works with images added via the &lt;img&gt; tag.

= Disabling LazyLoad on Specific Images =
If you want to disable LazyLoad on a specific image, you can do so by adding the `skip-lazy` class to the &lt;img&gt; HTML tag.

= What is LQIP? =
LQIP (Low Quality Image Placeholders) - it is function which to enable webpages to load correctly in an orderly manner, displaying ultra small, blurry images while the actual version is loading, which works well with lazy loading in JavaScript. This effectively reduces LCP for mobile and desktop. This method only works for the first image on the page - Post Thumbnail.
